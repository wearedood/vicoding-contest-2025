## 🏗️ Smart Contracts

### RewardDistributor.sol
A comprehensive smart contract for distributing rewards to Base ecosystem builders:

- **Multi-tier reward system** based on builder scores
- **Weekly reward distribution** mechanism
- **Builder registration** with GitHub username mapping
- **Emergency functions** and access controls
- **Event logging** for transparency
- **Batch and individual** reward claiming
- **Safety measures** with ReentrancyGuard

**Key Features:**
- Reward tiers: 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% based on score ranges
- Maximum 1B tokens total supply
- Weekly distribution cycles
- Builder score tracking
- Emergency withdrawal capabilities

### VicodingToken.sol
Feature-rich ERC20 token for the Vicoding Contest 2025:

- **ERC20 standard** with burning and pausing capabilities
- **Contribution-based rewards** with different multipliers
- **Batch reward processing** for efficiency
- **Comprehensive tracking** of contribution scores
- **Authorized minter system** for controlled distribution

**Token Economics:**
- Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 VCOD
- Initial Supply: 100,000,000 VCOD
- Reward Pool Reserve: 500,000,000 VCOD
- Max Mint per Address: 50,000 VCOD

**Contribution Multipliers:**
- Smart Contracts: 5x
- Bug Fixes: 4x
- Documentation: 3x
- GitHub Commits: 2x
- Other Contributions: 1x
